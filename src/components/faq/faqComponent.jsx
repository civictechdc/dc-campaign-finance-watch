          All the data on this site was downloaded from the Office of Campaign Finance site.
          All the data can be found

        <h4>What did we do after downloading the data?</h4>
        <div>
          In order to keep the data as pure as possible, no data was changed, only added.  The data we added is as follows:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Added unique ids for both candidates and campaigns run.</li>
          <li>
            Ran the contribution addresses through the Master Address Repository in order to verify addresses and collect additional information, such as ward
          </li>
          <li>
            (Currently not in use) Ran contributor name/address combos through a deduplication process to accurately track the unique contributors
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed "committee" contributions from the total count.  "Committee" contributions are money a campaign has already received and is being transferred to the official campaign.  For example, an exploratory committee would "contribute" the funds already collected if an official campaign is launched.
          </li>
        </ul>

    </Row>
    <Row>
      <Col xs={12}>
        <h4>What dates does the data include?</h4>
        <div>
          The data set currently available is 2006-2014, though we are in the process of updating it to add the current cycle's data.
        </div>
      </Col>
    </Row>
    <Row>
      <Col xs={12}>
        <h4>What can you do if the data seems wrong?</h4>
